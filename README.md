Portfolio Development Outline
Phase 1: Project Foundation
Initialize Project:

Create a new React project with Vite or Create React App.
Install essential dependencies:
@mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled for MUI components and styling.
react-router-dom for page routing.
Set up a Git repository for version control and connect it to GitHub (or another repository).
Organize File Structure:

In the src folder, create directories for components, pages, theme, and assets.
components: For reusable parts like Header, Footer, and ProjectCard.
pages: For Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
theme: For MUI theme configuration.
assets: For storing any static images, icons, or other media files.
Phase 2: Initial Layout and Routing
Set Up Routing:

Create empty pages for Home, About, Projects, and Contact in the pages folder.
Set up React Router in App.js with basic routes for each page.
Example: <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
Test routing by adding simple headings to each page (e.g., “Home Page”) and navigating between them.
Build Core Layout Components:

Header:
Add a simple navigation bar with links to each page (Home, About, Projects, Contact).
Style the links to give basic visual separation.
Footer:
Add placeholders for social media icons or contact links.
Position the Footer at the bottom of the viewport.
Import Header and Footer into App.js to appear on all pages.
Wrap page content within a main element to separate it from the header and footer visually.
Phase 3: Theme and Styling
Create MUI Theme in theme.js:

Define theme colors (e.g., primary and secondary colors) in palette.
Set up typography options, including fontFamily and responsive sizes for headings (h1, h2, etc.).
Export the theme and apply it in main.jsx with MUI’s ThemeProvider.
Responsive Layout Basics:

Use MUI’s Container component on each page to control max-width and centralize content.
Use sx props to adjust spacing, margin, and padding for components within the Container.
Test responsiveness by adjusting your browser size and refining layouts (like adjusting padding on smaller screens).
Phase 4: Core Components and Content
Home Page:

Add a greeting or professional tagline to introduce yourself.
Consider including a brief “About Me” or “What I Do” section with a few lines about your role or skillset.
Projects Section:

Design a ProjectCard component:
Use props for project title, description, tech stack, and links to live projects or GitHub repositories.
In Projects.js, create an array of objects representing each project (title, description, tech stack, link).
Map through this array to display a ProjectCard for each project dynamically.
Use MUI’s Card component as a base, customizing with sx for spacing and alignment.
About Page:

Expand on your professional background, skills, and interests.
Consider using an image of yourself if you’d like to add a personal touch.
Use MUI components like Typography for headings and List/ListItem for skills or tech stack.
Contact Form:

Create a contact form with TextField components for fields like Name, Email, and Message.
Add a submit button styled with MUI’s Button component.
(Optional) Integrate Formik for form management and Yup for validation.
Test the form layout and make sure it’s user-friendly on both desktop and mobile.
Phase 5: Advanced Styling and Animations
Add Icons and Visuals:

Install and import @mui/icons-material to add icons for social links in the footer (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn).
Use the IconButton component to style these icons in a visually cohesive way.
Polish Theme with Optional Light/Dark Mode:

Add support for light and dark color schemes if desired.
Include a toggle button in the Header to switch between light and dark modes.
Adjust color values in theme.js to define both light and dark modes.
Micro Animations:

Use CSS transitions on hover states for buttons and links.
Add a subtle scale effect on the ProjectCard component when hovered to draw attention.
Test animations to ensure they don’t affect performance or readability.
Phase 6: Final Touches and Deployment
Responsiveness Testing:

Test your portfolio on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
Adjust layouts or font sizes as necessary for different screen sizes.
Optimize Accessibility:

Add ARIA labels for better screen reader compatibility, especially on navigation links and form elements.
Test color contrast to ensure readability and accessibility on both light and dark modes.
Deployment:

Push your final code to GitHub (or another repository).
Deploy your portfolio using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for easy hosting.
Test the deployed site to confirm all routes, images, and links work as expected.
Post-Launch Checks:

Monitor for any user feedback or display issues and make adjustments as needed.
Regularly update your portfolio as you add new projects or gain new skills.
